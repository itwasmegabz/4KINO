# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.


<b> Here are the following issues I am trying to fix but cannot: </b>

I cannot like the post of somebody else, i can only like my own posts which make no sense. (I didn't have this issue in previous versions of the website).

Any replies to a reply above the first nested reply (e.g: above "1st reply to a commment") doesn't appear until I refresh the page which is annoying, once again I do not know how to fix that. The reply counter on any reply above "level 1" doesn't update until I refresh as well.

future features I want to add: 
connecting to imdb api or any other film database api.

Add a movie rating system and integrate that in the posts.

the current website is simply a blog dedicated to cinema.
